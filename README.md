# Weather Dashboard

## Description
--- 
This is a weather dashboard, that uses a third party API called [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The API was used to retrieve the inputed city's current weather and five day forecast. It pulls the data for temperature, humidity, wind speed, longitude, latitude, and the uv index from OpenWeather. As an avid traveler, I wanted to create an application that way I could track the weather of where I'm going. 

    Some of the concepts I learned: 
        * how to work with API's
        * how to store website url data to
          local storage
        
    I further understood:
        * jquery
        * local storage
        * creating elements with jquery

When the user opens the website you will see a search bar, with a search button next to it. Below the input area you will see a clear all. 

You enter a City within the US. 

Once you click enter, the current weather for that city will pop up and the five day forecast.

The users Search History will be saved in the Local Storage so that next time the site is visited they will see them under the search bar. Click on the Cities to populate that city you searched for.
